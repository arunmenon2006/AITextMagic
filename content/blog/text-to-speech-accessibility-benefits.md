Sentiment analysis is the process of using AI to determine the emotional tone behind a piece of text — whether it’s positive, negative, or neutral. It helps businesses and individuals make data-driven decisions based on how people feel about products, services, or topics.

### How Sentiment Analysis Works

AI algorithms analyze word choice, context, and language patterns to classify sentiment. For example, a positive review might use words like “excellent” or “love,” while a negative one may include “disappointed” or “poor.”
